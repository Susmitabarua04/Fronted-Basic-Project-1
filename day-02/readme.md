### Day 2 git practice 
`git diff`
***note***: *git diff works when we need to see the changes we made after commit*
 *and then we need to get out from that cheak out zone by clicking escape then colon and then "w" & "q"*

 `git checkout`
 *we can see in which file we made changes after final commit.*

 `git checkout -f`
 *to go to the first unchanged code  after final commit.*
